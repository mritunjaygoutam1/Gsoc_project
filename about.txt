## INTRODUCTION 
Communication via spoken language is a defining characteris-tic of human beings, and 
speech production is very likely the most  complicated   motor   act   performed   by 
any   species.      Speech  production  entails  the  coordination  of  the  many degrees
of  freedom  of  the  respiratory,  laryngeal  and  supra-glottal  articulatory  systems
to  convert  a  discretely specified  linguistic message to a quasi-continuous stream 
of sound that can  be  understood  by  a  listener.

 ARTICULATORY EVIDENCE FOR AUDITORY/ACOUSTIC GOALS 
We  have  conducted  several  experiments  in  which  measurements of articulatory movements
have provided evidence that thegoalsof speech movementsare auditory in nature.  In order
to  mure  articulatory  movements.
